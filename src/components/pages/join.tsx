        We opened in July of 2018 and are currently hiring at all levels. Our lab is a good fit for people who are
        dedicated to maintaining a positive, fun, and laid-back lab environment while doing rigorous science. Our
        guiding principle is that scientific rigor and kindness are not mutually exclusive.
